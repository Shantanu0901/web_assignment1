    				We started this organization on 1st January 2018. Our 1st goal was to interact and help the orphans. Then we moved towards with Women Protection Camp. We started spreding awarness about Women protection and equatily. We organized self defence camps for girls.
                    Now, we are trying to focus on Helping homeless people and we are looking forward for more volunteers to participate in our camp.
